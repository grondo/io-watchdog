Version 0.9 (2012-05-11):
 - Read config files once per node instead of once per task in spank plugin.

Version 0.8 (2010-08-23):
 - Fix bug in SLURM plugin which caused a failure of the --io-watchdog
    option to invoke the io watchdog unless the 'rank' option was used. 
 - Add log messages to SLURM plugin to aid debugging.

Version 0.7 (2009-11-17):
 - Add io-watchdog client API to get/set current watchdog timeout interval.
 - Add -q, --quiet option to io-watchdog(1).
 - Set IO_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT and IO_WATCHDOG_TARGET in io-watchdog action scripts.
 - Fix io-watchdog hangs on exec(2) failure.
 - The io-watchdog now exits by default after the first timeout event. A
    new option --persistent is available to get the old behavior. Note
    that the user process will continue running after the io-watchdog exits.
 - Split io-watchdog RPM into libs, devel, and slurm subpackages.
 - Add a small testsuite to the io-watchdog distribution.
