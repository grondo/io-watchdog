.SH NAME
io-watchdog.conf \- IO Watchdog configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/io-watchdog/io-watchdog.conf
.br
~/.io-watchdogrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
The io watchdog driver utility \fBio-watchdog\fR(1) along with the
SLURM \fBio-watchdog\fR plugin obtain configuration data from
the following sources:
.PP
.RS 8
1. system configuration file: /etc/io-watchdog/io-watchdog.conf
.br
.ns
2. user configuration file: ~/.io-watchdogrc
.br
.ns
3. environment
.br
.ns
4. command-line options
.RE
.PP
Where the last value found overrides all others. Therefore, the
command-line overrides the environment, which overrides the
user configuration file and so on.
.PP
The configuration file has the following format:
.PP
Everything after a '#' character is considered a comment, and
empty lines are ignored. Otherwise, each line of the config
file should contain one of the following:
.TP 8
\fBtimeout\fR = \fIN\fR[\fISUFFIX\fR]
Set the io watchdog timeout to \fIN\fR seconds. If \fISUFFIX\fR is supplied
it can be 's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for
hours, or 'd' for days. N may be an arbitrary floating point 
number.
.TP
\fBactions\fR = \fRNAME\fR[,\fINAME\fR,...]
Set the list of IO watchdog actions to \fINAME\fR. Multiple actions
may be specified as a comma or whitespace separated list.
.TP
\fBrank\fR = \fIN\fR
Set the target rank for the IO watchdog to \fIN\fR.
.TP
\fBtarget\fR = \fIPATTERN\fR
Only target processes matching the globbing pattern \fIPATTERN\fR.
This is useful when running processes under other utlities such
as \fBtime\fR(1) to avoid running the IO watchdog on the \fBtime\fR
process. 
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fIDIR\fR,...
Prepend search directory list \fIDIR\fR,... to the list of paths
to check for IO watchdog actions. Either whitespace or comma-delimted
list is acceptable.
.TP
\fBaction\fR \fINAME\fR = \fISCRIPT\fR
Define an action of \fINAME\fR to be the supplied \fISCRIPT\fR. \fISCRIPT\fR
can also be a script with arguments, for example:

 'action name = "script args..."'
.TP
\fBprogram\fR \fIPATTERN\fR
Define application specific settings for all programs whose
names match the globbing pattern \fIPATTERN\fR. When a \fBprogram\fR
section is encountered in the config file, all subsequent \fBtimeout\fR,
\fBactions\fR, \fBrank\fR, and \fBtarget\fR settins will apply only to
applications whose names match the given pattern. All \fBprogram\fR
sections should appear at the end of the config file.

.SH FILES
.TP 8
~/.io-watchdogrc
This is the default user IO watchdog configuration file. It is read
by default at startup unless a different config file is explictly 
chosen by the user at runtime.
.TP
/etc/io-watchdog/io-watchdog.conf
This is the system configuration file for the IO watchdog. System
defaults and search paths for system supplied actions should be
placed in this file. Settings in this file can be overridden by
the user configuration and command-line.

.SH EXAMPLES
An example user configuration file follows:
.nf
#
#  IO Watchdog config file
#

#  Search these directories for scripts that may be used
#   as IO watchdog actions:

search /home/grondo/bin, /home/grondo/scripts

#  Some user-defined actions:

action foo = /bin/date
action bar = "/admin/scripts/jr -x $SLURM_JOBID"

#  Defaults
timeout = 0.5h
rank = 0
actions = foo

#  Settings for specific programs

program *myapp*
   timeout = 5m
   rank = 0
   actions = email, foo, bar
   # Target defaults to same pattern given in "program"
   # statement above. 

program *test*
   timeout = 1.5s
   # Use defaults for actions and rank etc.
