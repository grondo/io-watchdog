.SH NAME
io-watchdog \- IO Watchdog driver utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B io-watchdog
[\fIOPTION\fR]... executable args...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The IO watchdog is a facility for monitoring user applications and 
parallel jobs for hangs which typically have a side-effect of ceasing
all IO in an application (i.e. one that writes something to a log or
data file during each cyle of computation.).  The watchdog attempts to 
monitor all IO generated from an application and triggers a set of 
user-defined actions when IO has stopped for a configurable timeout period.
.PP
The \fBio-watchdog\fR utility is used to start applications under the
IO watchdog service and configure watchdog parameters. This utility
is typically needed when a job is run outside SLURM. When jobs
are run under SLURM, the \-\-io-watchdog option to \fBsrun\fR(1)
can be used when the io-watchdog plugin is enabled. The \fBsrun\fR
option \-\-io-watchdog=help can be used to display a short help
message for running the IO watchdog under SLURM.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-h, --help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "-v, --verbose"
Increase the verbosity of the io watchdog.
.TP
.BI "-l, --list-actions"
List pre-defined system and user actions then exit. System actions
are those scripts found in the default search path, or any search
paths added to the system io-watchdog.conf file.
.TP
.BI "-f, --config=" FILE
Load configuration from file FILE. The config file specified 
will override the default user config file ~/.io-watchdogrc. This
option may be a convenient way to replace the use of other
watchdog configuration options below.
.TP
.BI "-t, --timeout=" NUMBER[SUFFIX]
Set watchdog timeout to NUMBER seconds. If supplied SUFFIX may be 's' 
for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, or 'd' for days.
NUMBER may be an arbitrary floating-point number.
.TP
.BI "-a, --action=" SCRIPT,...
Run action SCRIPT on watchdog trigger. More than one action
may be specified. An action should be either a full patch to
a script, one of the scripts in the default or user-defined
search path, or an action defined in the config file as 

 action name = "script args..."

.TP
.BI "-T, --target=" PATTERN
Only target processes with names matching the shell globbing
pattern PATTERN (See glob(7)). This option is useful when 
running applications under other processes such as \fBtime\fR(1),
as it avoids enabling the io watchdog on the \fBtime\fR process.
.TP
.BI "-r, --rank=" N
Only target rank N (default = 0) of a SLURM job.

.TP
.BI "-e, --exact-timeout"
Use a more precise method for the IO watchdog timeout. By default the
IO watchdog uses a simple and very lightweight method for tracking IO
in the interest of impacting the application as little as possible.
The actual time at which the watchdog may timeout will be anywhere
from N to 2*N, where N is the timeout period specified by the user.
With the \fI\-\-exact-timeout\fR option, the IO watchdog will track
the time of the last application write so that the timeout can be
as exact as possible. However, this will affect IO performance, since
a timestamp must be generated on every write call. The magnitude of
the impact is dependent on the rate of calls to write, not necessarily
the amount of data written.
